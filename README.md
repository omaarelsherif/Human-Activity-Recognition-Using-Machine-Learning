<!-- PROJECT TITLE -->
<h1 align="center">Human Activity Recognition</h1>

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## ➲ Project description
Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data
recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined Human activities,
The problem will be solved using K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) algorithm where we will train the model on dataset of collection of 
human activites in order to classifying them based on categories
